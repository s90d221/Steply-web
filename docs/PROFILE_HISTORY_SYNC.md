# Steply Web Profile Query & History Sync

## PC responsibility

The PC Web app is now the analysis host:

1. Creates QR session
2. Receives mobile profile payload
3. Shows a profile query button in the left rail
4. Receives mobile camera frames
5. Runs MediaPipe worker analysis
6. Keeps final result in an in-memory session cache only
7. Broadcasts final results back to the mobile WebSocket client
8. Clears session personal data when the phone ends or disconnects the session

## Profile fields shown on PC

- name / displayName
- age
- gender
- heightCm
- movementNotes
- safetyNote

Click `프로필 정보 조회` to re-fetch the current session status from the server and refresh the connected profile card.

## Result sync back to mobile

When `/api/analysis/final` is called, `analysisService.saveFinalResult()` stores the result only in the current Node process memory and broadcasts:

```json
{
  "type": "final",
  "result": { ... }
}
```

The Android camera WebSocket listens for this final message and stores the result in local Room history.

PC Web must not create or retain `data/history.json`. Mobile requests cleanup with `POST /api/session/{sessionId}/cleanup`; WebSocket disconnect performs the same cleanup as a fallback.
